TODO

- [X] Display in full screen, instead of a window.
- Change the mode indicator, which is in the first line, to the last one, displaying the full mode instead
of just the first letter. Implement the two lines in the bottom: a status line and a command line.
- Investigate of the options for not having each character use an object. Either use something for each line or
for each paragraph, or maybe use a flyweight pattern.
- Continue with the rest of the features copilot suggested:
 (file I/O, more commands, multi-line support, etc.)
- [X] Get rid of LoopStatus, and comeback to returning just a boolean. It is not needed, we will keep track
of the state (mode) in KeyHandler.

ARCHIVED
- Change from vim keybindings to helix keybindings. --> Won't do.
